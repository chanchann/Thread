/*
1. Perform some handshaking with server
2. Load Data from XML files.
3. Do processing on data loaded from XML.
As we can see that Task 1 is not dependent on any other Tasks but Task 3 is dependent on Task 2. 
So, it means Task 1 and Task 2 can be run in parallel by different Threads to improve the performance of application.

Option 1:

Make a Boolean global variable with default value false. 
Set its value to true in Thread 2 and Thread 1 will keep on checking its value in loop and as soon as it becomes true Thread 1 will continue with processing of data. 
But as itâ€™s a global variable shared by both of the Threads it needs synchronization with mutex.

disadvantages:

Thread will keep on acquiring the lock and release it just to check the value, 
therefore it will consume CPU cycles and will also make Thread 1 slow, because it needs to acquire same lock to update the bool flag.
